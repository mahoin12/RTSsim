# RTSsim

This is my first Game Developer job assignment.

What they wanted from me in 6 days;

-A 2-dimensional "Tile System" should be created by using the parameters (the length of 1 side of the square land, the length of 1 side of the square tiles) to be given by the user.

-The "Number of Soldiers" (Max 1000) to be given by the user must be created in groups of 10.

-A spider camera must be created during the simulation. The camera must be able to move forward, backward, right and left on the same plane. It should be able to Zoom In with the X key and Zoom Out with the C key.

-The soldiers must run towards random positions and stop for 5 seconds when they reach the given point. After 5 seconds it should move again to a random position. Dust particles should be released during movement.

-When the zoom level goes up, the groups with the soldiers should be shown with a symbol. When the zoom level gets closer, the symbol should disappear and particle effects should appear along with the meshes.
